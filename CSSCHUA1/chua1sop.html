<h1> Statement of the Problem </h1>
<hr>
<p>1. What is the estimated level and area of plastic accumulation in the Marikina River based on LSPIV-derived surface flow velocity?
<br>2. Which characteristics derived from LSPIV contribute most to plastic accumulation during flood events?
<br>3. Does the river topology and flow have a distinct relationship with the accumulation of plastic in the Marikina River according to LSPIV?
.</p>

<br><br>

<p><h1> Hypotheses</h1>
<hr>
<p>1H1: No significant plastic accumulation is observed in the Marikina River based on LSPIV-derived flood velocity data.
<br>1H0: Significant plastic accumulation is observed in the Marikina River, particularly in flood-prone barangays identified through LSPIV analysis.
<br>2H1: No specific LSPIV-derived surface flow characteristic contributes more to plastic accumulation than others.
<br>2H0: Certain LSPIV-derived surface flow characteristics contribute most to plastic accumulation during flood events.
<br>3H1: No relationship is seen between the river topology and flow with the plastic accumulation according to LSPIV.
<br>3H0: A relative relationship is seen between the river topology and flow with the plastic accumulation according to LSPIV.
