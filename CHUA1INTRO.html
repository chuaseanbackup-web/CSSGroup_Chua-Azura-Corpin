<h1> Introduction </h1>
<hr>
<p>The lack of well-established predictive models tailored to the Marikina River in the Philippines makes it challenging to quantify the transport of plastic debris in urban river systems. Due to the rapid mobilization and redistribution of plastic waste during flood events, this knowledge gap poses significant risks to public safety and the environment. Unmanaged plastic waste can impede drainage systems, exacerbate the effects of flooding, and endanger aquatic ecosystems because Marikina City is highly susceptible to typhoons and flooding. Therefore, creating efficient waste management and flood mitigation plans requires accurate forecasting of debris escape and accumulation.

	In order to forecast the movement of plastic debris during flood conditions, the study uses a geometry-driven mathematical model that examines the topology of the Marikina River.
    River slope, channel width, curvature, connecting branches are important geometric factors that
   affect debris transport and flow velocity. Debris input, retention, transport, and escape across various river segments are taken into account by model components. The findings pinpoint high-risk escape routes and topographically controlled accumulation zones during peak discharge events. This study supports sustainable river management in Marikina City and lays the groundwork for focused cleanup initiatives.
